# Angular Component Definer
## Description
__Angular Component Definer__ is a tool for separating and grouping the files of any Angular project into Angular Components, while also highlighting the Angular Module files, Service files, Directives and Guards. This project is both a standalone tool and a plugin developed for _DX Platform_, a platform for visualizing data and extracting information from software systems.

Moreover, this is also a university project implemented by _Radu Sergiu Valentin_, and _Manolache Miruna Andreea_, under the supervision of professor _Mario Riviş_, for the _CES_ course at _Politechnic University of Timişoara_.
#### The tool's usefulness as a plugin for _DX Platform_
Once paired with _DX Platform_ it can be of great use when analyzing Angular projects. Possible valuable system information that could be extracted using the __Angular Component Definer__ plugin: 
* Gauging each developer's knowledge on each component
* Tracking the system evolution based on how new components were being added through time
* Identifying problematic components, and bug magnets
* Estimating a raport of number of components to number of modules etc.
